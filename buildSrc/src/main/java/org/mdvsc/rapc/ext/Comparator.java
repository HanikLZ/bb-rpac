/**
 * A comparison function, which imposes a <i>total ordering</i> on
 * some collection of objects.  Comparators can be passed to a sort
 * method (such as {@link Collections#sort(List,Comparator)
 * Collections.sort} or {@link Arrays#sort(Object[],Comparator)
 * Arrays.sort}) to allow precise control over the sort order.
 * Comparators can also be used to control the order of certain data
 * The ordering imposed by a comparator {@code c} on a set of elements
 * {@code S} is said to be <i>consistent with equals</i> if and only if
 * {@code c.compare(e1, e2)==0} has the same boolean value as
 * {@code e1.equals(e2)} for every {@code e1} and {@code e2} in
 * {@code S}.<p>
 *
 * Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an
 * ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map).
 * Suppose a sorted set (or sorted map) with an explicit comparator {@code c}
 * is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set {@code S}.  If the
 * ordering imposed by {@code c} on {@code S} is inconsistent with equals,
 * the sorted set (or sorted map) will behave "strangely."  In particular the
 * sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or
 * map), which is defined in terms of {@code equals}.<p>
 *
 * For example, suppose one adds two elements {@code a} and {@code b} such that
 * {@code (a.equals(b) && c.compare(a, b) != 0)}
 * to an empty {@code TreeSet} with comparator {@code c}.
 * The second {@code add} operation will return
 * true (and the size of the tree set will increase) because {@code a} and
 * {@code b} are not equivalent from the tree set's perspective, even though
 * this is contrary to the specification of the
 * For the mathematically inclined, the <i>relation</i> that defines the
 * <i>imposed ordering</i> that a given comparator {@code c} imposes on a
 * given set of objects {@code S} is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) &lt;= 0}.
 * </pre> The <i>quotient</i> for this total order is:<pre>
 *       {(x, y) such that c.compare(x, y) == 0}.
 * </pre>
 *
 * It follows immediately from the contract for {@code compare} that the
 * quotient is an <i>equivalence relation</i> on {@code S}, and that the
 * imposed ordering is a <i>total order</i> on {@code S}.  When we say that
 * the ordering imposed by {@code c} on {@code S} is <i>consistent with
 * equals</i>, we mean that the quotient for the ordering is the equivalence
 * relation defined by the objects' {@link Object#equals(Object)
 * equals(Object)} method(s):<pre>
 *     {(x, y) such that x.equals(y)}. </pre>
 *
 * In other words, when the imposed ordering is consistent with
 * equals, the equivalence classes defined by the equivalence relation
 * of the {@code equals} method and the equivalence classes defined by
 * the quotient of the {@code compare} method are the same.

 * <p>Unlike {@code Comparable}, a comparator may optionally permit
 * comparison of null arguments, while maintaining the requirements for
 * an equivalence relation.
