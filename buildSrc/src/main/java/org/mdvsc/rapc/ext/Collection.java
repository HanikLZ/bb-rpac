/**
 * The root interface in the <i>collection hierarchy</i>.  A collection
 * represents a group of objects, known as its <i>elements</i>.  Some
 * collections allow duplicate elements and others do not.  Some are ordered,
 * and others are unordered. Collections that have a defined
 * <a href="SequencedCollection.html#encounter">encounter order</a>
 * implementations of this interface: it provides implementations of more
 * specific subinterfaces like {@code Set} and {@code List}.  This interface
 * is typically used to pass collections around and manipulate them where
 * maximum generality is desired.
 *
 * <p><i>Bags</i> or <i>multisets</i> (unordered collections that may contain
 * duplicate elements) should implement this interface directly.
 *
 * <p>All general-purpose {@code Collection} implementation classes (which
 * typically implement {@code Collection} indirectly through one of its
 * subinterfaces) should provide two "standard" constructors: a void (no
 * arguments) constructor, which creates an empty collection, and a
 * constructor with a single argument of type {@code Collection}, which
 * creates a new collection with the same elements as its argument.  In
 * effect, the latter constructor allows the user to copy any collection,
 * producing an equivalent collection of the desired implementation type.
 * There is no way to enforce this convention (as interfaces cannot contain
 * constructors) but all of the general-purpose {@code Collection}
 * implementations in the Java platform libraries comply.
 *
 * <p>Certain methods are specified to be
 * <i>optional</i>. If a collection implementation doesn't implement a
 * particular operation, it should define the corresponding method to throw
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. Such methods are marked "optional
 * operation" in method specifications of the collections interfaces.
 *
 * <p><a id="optional-restrictions"></a>Some collection implementations
 * have restrictions on the elements that they may contain.
 * For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * {@code NullPointerException} or {@code ClassCastException}.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the collection may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>It is up to each collection to determine its own synchronization
 * policy.  In the absence of a stronger guarantee by the
 * implementation, undefined behavior may result from the invocation
 * of any method on a collection that is being mutated by another
 * thread; this includes direct invocations, passing the collection to
 * a method that might perform invocations, and using an existing
 * iterator to examine the collection.
 *
 * <p>Many methods in Collections Framework interfaces are defined in
 * terms of the {@link Object#equals(Object) equals} method.  For example,
 * the specification for the {@link #contains(Object) contains(Object o)}
 * method says: "returns {@code true} if and only if this collection
 * contains at least one element {@code e} such that
 * {@code (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e))}."  This specification should
 * <i>not</i> be construed to imply that invoking {@code Collection.contains}
 * with a non-null argument {@code o} will cause {@code o.equals(e)} to be
 * invoked for any element {@code e}.  Implementations are free to implement
 * optimizations whereby the {@code equals} invocation is avoided, for
 * example, by first comparing the hash codes of the two elements.  (The
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} specification guarantees that two objects with
 * unequal hash codes cannot be equal.)  More generally, implementations of
 * the various Collections Framework interfaces are free to take advantage of
 * the specified behavior of underlying {@link Object} methods wherever the
 * implementor deems it appropriate.
 *
 * <p>Some collection operations which perform recursive traversal of the
 * collection may fail with an exception for self-referential instances where
 * the collection directly or indirectly contains itself. This includes the
 * {@code clone()}, {@code equals()}, {@code hashCode()} and {@code toString()}
 * methods. Implementations may optionally handle the self-referential scenario,
 * however most current implementations do not do so.
 *
 * <h2><a id="view">View Collections</a></h2>
 *
 * <p>Most collections manage storage for elements they contain. By contrast, <i>view
 * collections</i> themselves do not store elements, but instead they rely on a
 * backing collection to store the actual elements. Operations that are not handled
 * by the view collection itself are delegated to the backing collection. Examples of
 * view collections include the wrapper collections returned by methods such as
 * Other examples of view collections include collections that provide a
 * different representation of the same elements, for example, as
 * provided by {@link List#subList List.subList},
 * Any changes made to the backing collection are visible in the view collection.
 * Correspondingly, any changes made to the view collection &mdash; if changes
 * are permitted &mdash; are written through to the backing collection.
 * Although they technically aren't collections, instances of
 * {@link Iterator} and {@link ListIterator} can also allow modifications
 * to be written through to the backing collection, and in some cases,
 * modifications to the backing collection will be visible to the Iterator
 * during iteration.
 *
 * <h2><a id="unmodifiable">Unmodifiable Collections</a></h2>
 *
 * <p>Certain methods of this interface are considered "destructive" and are called
 * "mutator" methods in that they modify the group of objects contained within
 * the collection on which they operate. They can be specified to throw
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if this collection implementation
 * does not support the operation. Such methods should (but are not required
 * to) throw an {@code UnsupportedOperationException} if the invocation would
 * have no effect on the collection. For example, consider a collection that
 * does not support the {@link #add add} operation. What will happen if the
 * {@link #addAll addAll} method is invoked on this collection, with an empty
 * collection as the argument? The addition of zero elements has no effect,
 * so it is permissible for this collection simply to do nothing and not to throw
 * an exception. However, it is recommended that such cases throw an exception
 * unconditionally, as throwing only in certain cases can lead to
 * programming errors.
 *
 * <p>An <i>unmodifiable collection</i> is a collection, all of whose
 * mutator methods (as defined above) are specified to throw
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}. Such a collection thus cannot be
 * modified by calling any methods on it. For a collection to be properly
 * unmodifiable, any view collections derived from it must also be unmodifiable.
 * For example, if a List is unmodifiable, the List returned by
 * {@link List#subList List.subList} is also unmodifiable.
 *
 * <p>An unmodifiable collection is not necessarily immutable. If the
 * contained elements are mutable, the entire collection is clearly
 * mutable, even though it might be unmodifiable. For example, consider
 * two unmodifiable lists containing mutable elements. The result of calling
 * {@code list1.equals(list2)} might differ from one call to the next if
 * the elements had been mutated, even though both lists are unmodifiable.
 * However, if an unmodifiable collection contains all immutable elements,
 * it can be considered effectively immutable.
 *
 * <h2><a id="unmodview">Unmodifiable View Collections</a></h2>
 *
 * <p>An <i>unmodifiable view collection</i> is a collection that is unmodifiable
 * and that is also a view onto a backing collection. Its mutator methods throw
 * {@code UnsupportedOperationException}, as described above, while
 * reading and querying methods are delegated to the backing collection.
 * The effect is to provide read-only access to the backing collection.
 * This is useful for a component to provide users with read access to
 * an internal collection, while preventing them from modifying such
 * collections unexpectedly. Examples of unmodifiable view collections
 * are those returned by the
 *
 * <h2><a id="serializable">Serializability of Collections</a></h2>
 *
 * <p>Serializability of collections is optional. As such, none of the collections
 * interfaces are declared to implement the {@link java.io.Serializable} interface.
 * However, serializability is regarded as being generally useful, so most collection
 * implementations are serializable.
 *
 * <p>The collection implementations that are public classes (such as {@code ArrayList}
 * or {@code HashMap}) are declared to implement the {@code Serializable} interface if they
 * are in fact serializable. Some collections implementations are not public classes,
 * such as the <a href="#unmodifiable">unmodifiable collections.</a> In such cases, the
 * serializability of such collections is described in the specification of the method
 * that creates them, or in some other suitable place. In cases where the serializability
 * of a collection is not specified, there is no guarantee about the serializability of such
 * collections. In particular, many <a href="#view">view collections</a> are not serializable,
 * even if the original collection is serializable.
 *
 * <p>A collection implementation that implements the {@code Serializable} interface cannot
 * be guaranteed to be serializable. The reason is that in general, collections
 * contain elements of other types, and it is not possible to determine statically
 * whether instances of some element type are actually serializable. For example, consider
 * a serializable {@code Collection<E>}, where {@code E} does not implement the
 * {@code Serializable} interface. The collection may be serializable, if it contains only
 * elements of some serializable subtype of {@code E}, or if it is empty. Collections are
 * thus said to be <i>conditionally serializable,</i> as the serializability of the collection
 * as a whole depends on whether the collection itself is serializable and on whether all
 * contained elements are also serializable.
